### I unpublished the theme.

I don't know how most of this actually works, i followed a tutorial to make this theme. It didn't turn out awfully but it's not great either.
Actually it was quite straining on the eyes with the dark blue background and a mix of red/beige and gray text. Perhaps i could've made it better by reducing the brightness of the background blues. I don't know.

pehaps when I learn some color theory and design I'll revisit this.
